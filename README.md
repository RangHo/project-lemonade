## What is this?

Project Lemonade is a series of programs created during my mandatory military service.

In the military, I regularly get disconnected from the rest of the world entirely as there is no such
thing as internet on the sea. (This does not imply that I have internet access when moored, though.)
That is, these programs are 100% built by me while banging my head against the mess hall table suffering
from hypo-stackoverflow syndrome.

Here are some features shared by the Project Lemonade programs:
1. Unintelligible gibberish source code
2. Questionable language choices
3. Topics which no sane people will choose

Many of the programs are left in the isolated computer in the ship, so most of the programs are re-written
from my incomplete recollection of the source code. Some sources that I was able to *print out* and bring to
society are heavily updated since. So... Technically, I'm not breaking any rules. Just letting you know!

## Okay, but *why* these languages?

......They do beg for this question, don't they?

Like any other military organizations in other countries, South Korea Navy requires thorough screening for
any binaries that are installed on devices connected to the Korean military intranet. Therefore, I had to
come up with something that I can get my hands on. Although a version of Anaconda distribution of Python was
available, its massive size made its installation virtually impossible over a 10KB/s satellite network.

Then, I was left with the following choices:
* Python
* Perl and Bash shell script from Git
* PowerShell 5 built into Windows 10
* VBA included in Hancom Office Hancell
* JavaScript available in Chrome

Of course, Python and JavaScript is just boring at this point, so I decided to spice things up by choosing
exotic languages that no one uses.

Yep, at the end of the day, I wanted to be a hipster.
