## What is this project?

Project Lemonade is a series of programs created during my mandatory military service.

In the military, I regularly get disconnected from the rest of the world entirely as there is no such
thing as internet on the sea. (This does not imply that I have internet access when moored, though.)
That is, these programs are 100% built by me while banging my head against the mess hall table suffering
from hypo-stackoverflow syndrome.

Here are some features shared by the Project Lemonade programs:
1. Unintelligible gibberish source code
2. Questionable language choices
3. Topics which no sane people will choose

Many of the programs are left in the isolated computer in the ship, so most of the programs are re-written
from my incomplete relocation of the source code. Some sources that I was able to *print out* and bring to
society are heavily updated since. Just letting you know!
